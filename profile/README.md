Hi there 👋! My name [is Josh Long (@starbuxman)](https://twitter.com/starbuxman), and this is [the Coffee + Software show](https://youtube.com/@coffeesoftware.com). I've got a lot of things I want to explore and very little time in which to do it. So, grab a cup of coffee and join me and we'll explore software together.
